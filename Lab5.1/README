Summary
Memory is always a scare respurce. No matter how much memory is available,
it never seems to be enough. 

This lecture tell us to allocate memory using "malloc" call in the standard C library to allocate 
a great deal of memory. Letâ€™s start with a very simple program, 
but one that would defeat old MS-DOS-based programs,because they cannot access memory outside thebase 640K memory map of PCs.

The first program asks the malloc library to give it a pointer to a megabyte of memory, it can check to ensure
that malloc was successful and then use some of the memory to show that it exists. 

If you run the program, it prints Hello World, showing that malloc did indeed return the megabyte
of usable memory. Because the malloc returns a void * pointer, it cast the result to the char * that its needed.
The malloc function is guaranteed to return memory that is aligned so that it can be cast to a pointer of
any type.
